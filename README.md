__Programming an Arty A7-100T FPGA with a Risc-V CPU__

The Arty A7-100T contains a Xilinx XC7A100T FPGA which is the largest FPGA available for the Arty A7 and is ideal for deployment of softcore processors.  In this repo we cover building a RISC-V processor, specifically the SiFive Freedom E310 and running this image on the FPGA.
