# Programming an Arty A7-100T FPGA with a RISC-V CPU

The Arty A7-100T contains a Xilinx XC7A100T FPGA which is the largest FPGA available for the Arty A7 and is ideal for deployment of softcore processors.  In this repo we cover building a RISC-V processor, specifically the SiFive Freedom E310 and running this image on the FPGA.


__Steps to perform__

1.  [Windows Subsystem for Linux setup and Ubuntu install](1-wsl-setup.md)

2.  [Linux toolchain build](2-linux-toolchain-build.md)

3.  [Compile FPGA image](3-compile-FPGA-image.md)

4.  [Step 4](Ex__4_arty_riscv.md)
